<Meta title="About Docodylus"/>

<img src={DocodylusBanner}/>
Docodylus is a set of extensions for React-based documentation frameworks, primarily [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

Docodylus is under development and should not be considered a 'release' yet. That said, anyone is welcome to use it, and to submit pull requests.

Docodylus is also an opportunity for me, personally, to explore facets of software development that I may or may not have been able to deep-dive into before, and to experience building a library from the ground-up without any more experienced developers to lean on.

### Why "Docodylus"?
While working with Docusaurus, I found it does _lots_ of great stuff
for structuring, building and deploying a documentation site. But I
also encountered a lot of situations where a component implementing a simple layout feature was absent, or I didn't like Docusaurus's handling of it.

While working on my personal website (which is developed with
Docusaurus), I started developing components in-place to fill these gaps, and
eventually decided I really ought to make them a reusable library. Docodylus is that library.

So, Docodylus is a close evolutionary descendant of Docusaurus, just as Crocodiles are close evolutionary descendants of Dinosaurs.

I needed a shorter namespace than **docusaurus-extensions**, okay?
